# ImageViewer

Requires you to install [node+npm](https://nodejs.org/en/), and generate a file names file yourself using windows' dir command: go in the coom folder with cmd -> "dir /s /b > ../[FolderName]fnames.txt". Then go in the ImageViewer folder and do "npm start". By default starts on localhost:3000. You need to create a blank [FolderName]selectedNames.txt file in the public/selectedNames folder (for images that start selected, where selected means they stay there if you regen the images. You can click on images to mark them as selected and can press the save selected button to save your selected images as [FolderName]selectedNames.txt so your favorites are always there on top if you tick the start with selected checkbox) and put the [FolderName]fnames.txt you generated in the public/fnames folder. Then add the [FolderName] to the types array in *viewpics.js*, pick it in the dropdown, and click regen.
